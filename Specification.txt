Specification


it's basically WorldEdit's commands that allow certain people into a region
You have Set X and Player Y and C want to film in it
so if no one is using Set X, player Y can type
/cset claim SetX and then only player Y has access to walk in and out of the set
Player Y wants PLayer C's help so PLayer Y types /cset add PlayerC so then player C can now also walk in and out

(Select regions like world edit and guard)
(Separate to world guard regions (building, flags, etc)
(if a player isn't apart of any set perhaps a warning message)

/cset new <set name>
      After selecting a region a staff member can            make that region a set

/cset remove <set name>
      Removes current standing set

(Optional) /cset list
       displays a list of all current sets

/cset claim <set name>
      A player can claim a set
      (Turns on flag for walking in and out to the player that claimed the set)

/cset add <player>
      Adds a player to the current set (have to be already added to a set/claimed the set)

/cset remove <player>
      Removes a player from the current set
(staff should be able to remove anyone from any set so like a cset.remove.other node? (maybe same for adding??) Also maybe staff do not have to be in a set to add/remove? Sudo command is a option if you can not do this)

/cset leave
       Players leaves a the current set (Maybe have a difference between claimer and member to a set? if claimer leaves, the set is discarded for anyone's use. if member leaves the set is still claimed by the claimer)
